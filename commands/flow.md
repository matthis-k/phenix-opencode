agent: phenix-workflow

Run the adaptive Phenix task-DAG workflow for this request:

$ARGUMENTS

1. Save the original request to `.phenix-agent-state/request.md` and `.phenix-agent-state/tasks/<task-id>/task.yaml` when a stateful workflow is needed.
2. Classify task complexity and select the minimum sufficient pipeline:
   - simple_local
   - medium_local_verified
   - dag_verified
   - dag_full_verified
   - full_complete_test
   - dag_commit_sync
3. Discover optional repo contracts if present:
   - `AGENTS.md`
   - `docs/*`
   - `CLAUDE.md` or `.claude/`
   - `knowledge/`
   - `CONTRIBUTING.md`
   - `.opencode/agents/*`
4. Do not fail only because these optional files are absent.
5. Build or update the task DAG, task packet, lease, handoff memory, and checkpoint requirements.
6. Invoke only the `phenix-*` agents required by the task DAG.
7. For tracked edits, route writes through `phenix-worker`; workflow must not edit tracked files directly.
8. Prefer tend/stitch MCP tools for structured operations and record `transport: mcp`; use CLI fallback only when MCP is unavailable, insufficient, or raw command output is needed, and record `transport: cli`.
9. Use stitch for cross-repo DAG scope/order and tend for local task/profile semantics. Do not manually loop through repos when stitch can express the operation.
10. For user-facing UI/UX changes, invoke `uiux-designer` before implementation.
11. Verify all tracked edits before completion using the selected verification DAG/profile/scope.
12. On verification failure, require a checkpoint, invoke `failure-analyzer` if useful, and re-run only the required task-DAG path.
13. Do not commit by default. If `$ARGUMENTS` explicitly requests `local commit`, `commit`, `commit and push`, `sync`, `sync commit`, or `synced commit`, treat that as an explicit post-verification commit policy.
14. Run any requested commit policy only after required verifier success and only through `phenix-commit-sync` or an equivalent Stitch-backed route.
15. If the working tree contains pre-existing or user-authored dirty changes
    outside the planned changes ("external changes"), route them through the
    external-change commit-inclusion pipeline (acknowledgement, classification,
    secret review, verifier evidence, commit-summary documentation, Stitch-only)
     after verifier success and before any commit route executes.
