# Phenix glossary

## WorkScope terminology

- **WorkScope**: The single semantic model for a request. It carries task class,
  complexity (`c0`..`c4`), risk, capabilities, routing, invariants, boundaries,
  verification expectations, and escalation triggers.
- **c0**: Inspect/read-only work. No tracked-file edits; minimal preflight; no
  heavyweight `.phenix-agent-state/` unless recovery or handoff is needed.
- **c1**: Trivial mechanical maintenance with obvious intent and tiny blast radius.
  Minimal preflight; no heavyweight `.phenix-agent-state/` unless recovery or handoff
  is needed.
- **c2**: Localized low-risk edit with clear intent. Route directly to worker when
  capabilities and invariants allow it and no architecture/release/destructive or
  security trigger is present.
- **c3**: Semantic or ambiguous work requiring planner output; architect is
  conditional on a concrete architecture boundary.
- **c4**: High-risk, release/control-plane, workflow/agent routing, permission,
  public API/config, flake output/topology, CI/deployment, module ownership,
  commit/push/publish/deploy, tracked deletion, secrets/auth, or downstream-risk
  work. Requires planner, architect, worker, and strict verifier.
- **Explicit-gated action**: Commit, push, publish, deploy, tracked deletion,
  secrets/auth mutation, and permission weakening. These require explicit user
  approval and c4 handling.

## Phenix commit terminology

When the user asks for a **local commit**, commit only the current node/repository. Do not push. Do not walk the DAG. Do not update downstream flake inputs unless explicitly requested.

When the user asks for a **commit**, commit the current node/repository and push it. This is a single-node operation. Do not walk the DAG and do not update downstream consumers.

When the user asks for a **sync commit**, **commit sync**, **synced commit**, or just **sync** in a commit context, perform the DAG-aware commit operation: compute the affected DAG, walk it dependency-first, update downstream flake inputs where required, commit each affected node, and push each affected node.

Alias rules:

- `commit locally` = `local commit`
- `local commit` = commit current node only, no push
- `commit` = commit current node and push
- `commit and push` = `commit`
- `sync commit` = `synced commit`
- `commit sync` = `synced commit`
- `synced commit` = DAG-aware commit with flake input propagation and push
- `sync` in a commit/finalization context = `synced commit`

If the user's wording is ambiguous, prefer the safest narrower interpretation:
single-node `commit` rather than DAG-wide `synced commit`, unless the user mentions sync, DAG, flake input propagation, downstream consumers, or multiple Phenix nodes.

- **Affected DAG**: The selected nodes plus dependency-graph neighbors that must
  be checked because a change can affect them.
- **Provider**: A lower-layer repo that exports pins, packages, tools, or shared
  contracts consumed by other repos.
- **Consumer**: A higher-layer repo that depends on providers to compose runtime,
  desktop, host, or workspace behavior.
- **Root workspace**: The top-level `phenix` repo that aggregates active
  subflakes and coordinates verification; it is not a child dependency provider.
- **Retired repo**: A former repo or role kept only for historical notes and not
  included in active topology, root inputs, hooks, or normal verification.
